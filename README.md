`puzzle_page.dart`
1. <b>Drag and Drop</b>: Users can drag puzzle blocks from a horizontal list and drop them onto the drop target area.

2. <b>Snap-to-Grid</b>: When a block is dropped near another block, it snaps into place with a grid-like alignment, making it easier to arrange the blocks correctly.

3. <b>Reset Functionality</b>: Users can reset the puzzle to its initial state, clearing all dropped blocks.

4. <b>Connection Detection</b>: Once the puzzle is solved by arranging the blocks in the correct order, the app detects the connections between the blocks and displays a list of connected images.

5. <b>Bluetooth Integration</b>: The app provides an option to connect to Bluetooth devices via the BluetoothHelper class, accessible through the app bar.


`bluetooth_helper.dart`
1. <b>Start Bluetooth Scan</b>: Initiates Bluetooth scanning in the Flutter app to discover available devices for connection.

2. <b>Permission Check</b>: Checks for location permission to utilize Bluetooth functionalities, requesting it from the user if not granted.

3. <b>Display Scanned Devices</b>: Presents scanned Bluetooth devices in a dialog, allowing users to select their desired device for connection.

4. <b>Display Connected Device</b>: If a device is already connected, displays its information in a dialog and provides an option to disconnect.

5. <b>Connection and Disconnection</b>: Attempts to establish a connection with the selected Bluetooth device and provides an option to disconnect from the connected device.

6. <b>Connection Status Notification</b>: Notifies the user of the success or failure of connection and disconnection operations via toast messages.


`bluetooth_communication.dart`
1. <b>Connection Establishment</b>: Establishes a connection with a Bluetooth device.

2. <b>Service and Characteristic Discovery</b>: Discovers services and characteristics of the connected Bluetooth device.

3. <b>Data Reception</b>: Subscribes to notifications for receiving data from the connected device.

4. <b>Data Transmission</b>: Sends data to the connected Bluetooth device.
